This function is called the wavefunction or state function and has the property that \\(\\Psi^{*}({\\bf r},t)\\Psi({\\bf r},t)d\\tau\\) is the probability that the particle lies in the volume element \\(d\\tau\\) located at \\({\\bf r}\\) and time \\(t\\).\n\nThis is the _probabalistic_ interpretation of the wavefunction. As a result the wavefunction must satisfy the condition that finding the particle _somewhere_ in space is 1 and this gives us the normalisation condition,\n\n\\[\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\Psi^{*}({\\bf r},t)\\Psi({\\bf r},t)d\\tau=1\\]\n\nThe other conditions on the wavefunction that arise from the probabilistic interpretation are that it must be single-valued, continuous and finite. We normally write wavefunctions with a normalisation constant included.\n\n### Postulate 2\n\nTo every observable in classical mechanics there corresponds a linear, Hermitian operator in quantum mechanics.\n\nThis postulate comes from the observation that the expectation value of an operator that corresponds to an observable must be real and therefore the operator must be Hermitian. Some examples of Hermitian operators are:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{l l l l}\n**Observable** & **Classical Symbol** & **Quantum Operator** & **Operation** \\\\ position & \\({\\bf r}\\) & \\(\\hat{r}\\) & multiply by \\({\\bf r}\\) \\\\ momentum & \\({\\bf p}\\) & \\(\\hat{p}\\) & \\(-i\\hbar(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}+\\hat{j}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}+\\hat{k} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z})\\) \\\\ kinetic energy & \\(T\\) & \\(\\hat{T}\\) & \\(\\frac{-\\hbar^{2}}{2m}(\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x^{2}}+\\frac{\\partial^{2}} {\\partial y^{2}}+\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial z^{2}})\\) \\\\ potential energy & \\(V({\\bf r})\\) & \\(\\hat{V}({\\bf r})\\) & multiply by \\(V({\\bf r})\\) \\\\ total energy & \\(E\\) & \\({\\cal H}\\) & \\(\\frac{-\\hbar^{2}}{2m}(\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x^{2}}+\\frac{\\partial^{2}} {\\partial y^{2}}+\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial z^{2}})+V({\\bf r})\\) \\\\ angular momentum & \\(l_{x}\\) & \\(\\hat{l}_{x}\\) & \\(-i\\hbar(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}-z\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y})\\) \\\\  & \\(l_{y}\\) & \\(\\hat{l}_{y}\\) & \\(-i\\hbar(x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}-x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z})\\) \\\\  & \\(l_{z}\\) & \\(\\hat{l}_{z}\\) & \\(-i\\hbar(x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}-y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x})\\) \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\n### Postulate 3\n\nIn any measurement of the observable associated with operator \\(\\hat{A}\\), the only values that will ever be observed are the eigenvalues, \\(a\\), that satisfy the eigenvalue equation,\n\n\\[\\hat{A}\\Psi=a\\Psi\\]This is the postulate that the values of dynamical variables are quantized in quantum mechanics (although it is possible to have a continuum of eigenvalues in the case of unbound states). If the system is in an eigenstate of \\(\\hat{A}\\) with eigenvalue \\(a\\) then any measurement of the quantity \\(A\\) will always yield the value \\(a\\).\n\nAlthough measurement will always yield a value, the initial state does not have to be an eigenstate of \\(\\hat{A}\\). An arbitrary state can be expanded in the complete set of eigenvectors of \\(\\hat{A}\\), \\(\\hat{A}\\Psi_{i}=a_{i}\\Psi_{i}\\), as\n\n\\[\\Psi=\\sum_{i}^{n}c_{i}\\Psi_{i}\\]\n\nwhere \\(n\\) may go to infinity. In this case measurement of \\(A\\) will yield _one_ of the eigenvalues, \\(a_{i}\\), but we don't know which one. The _probability_ of observing the eigenvalue \\(a_{i}\\) is given by the absolute value of the square of the coefficient, \\(|\\!|c_{i}|\\!|^{2}\\). The third postulate also implies that, after the measurement of \\(\\Psi\\) yields some value, \\(a_{i}\\), the wavefunction _collapses_ into the eigenstate, \\(\\Psi_{i}\\) that corresponds to \\(a_{i}\\). If \\(a_{i}\\) is degenerate \\(\\Psi\\) collapses onto the degenerate subspace.

A. M. Dirac, 1851 Exhibition Senior Research Student, St. John's College, Cambridge.\n\n(Communicated by R. H. Fowler, F.R.S.--Received November 7th, 1925.)\n\n**SS 1.**_Introduction._\n\nIt is well known that the experimental facts of atomic physics necessitate a departure from the classical theory of electrodynamics in the description of atomic phenomena. This departure takes the form, in Bohr's theory, of the special assumptions of the existence of stationary states of an atom, in which it does not radiate, and of certain rules, called quantum conditions, which fix the stationary states and the frequencies of the radiation emitted during transitions between them. These assumptions are quite foreign to the classical theory, but have been very successful in the interpretation of a restricted region of atomic phenomena. The only way in which the classical theory is used is through the assumption that the classical laws hold for the description of the motion in the stationary states, although they fail completely during transitions, and the assumption, called the Correspondence Principle, that the classical theory gives the right results in the limiting case when the action per cycle of the system is large compared to Planck's constant \\(h\\), and in certain other special cases.\n\nIn a recent paper* Heisenberg puts forward a new theory, which suggests that it is not the equations of classical mechanics that are in any way at fault, but that the mathematical operations by which physical results are deduced from them require modification. _All_ the information supplied by the classical theory can thus be made use of in the new theory.\n\n**SS 2.**_Quantum Algebra._\n\nConsider a multiply periodic non-degenerate dynamical system of \\(u\\) degrees of freedom, defined by equations connecting the co-ordinates and their time differential coefficients. We may solve the problem on the classical theory in the following way. Assume that each of the co-ordinates \\(x\\) can be expanded in the form of a multiple Fourier series in the time \\(t\\), thus,\n\n\\[x=\\Sigma_{a_{1}...a_{n}}x\\left(a_{1}a_{2}...\\,a_{n}\\right)\\,\\exp.\\,i\\left(a_{ 1}a_{1}+a_{2}a_{02}+...\\,+a_{n}a_{n}\\right)t\\]\n\n\\[=\\Sigma_{a}x_{a}\\,\\exp.\\,i\\left(a_{0}\\right)t,\\]\n\n* Heisenberg, *Zeits. f. Phys.,* vol. 33, p. 879 (1925).\n\nsay, for brevity. Substitute these values in the equations of motion, and equate the coefficients on either side of each harmonic term. The equations obtained in this way (which we shall call the \\(\\Lambda\\) equations) will determine each of the amplitudes \\(x_{\\bullet}\\) and frequencies (zo), (the frequencies being measured in radians per unit time). The solution will not be unique. There will be a \\(u\\)-fold infinity of solutions, which may be labelled by taking the amplitudes and frequencies to be functions of \\(u\\) constants \\(\\kappa_{1}\\,...\\,\\kappa_{u}\\). Each \\(x_{\\bullet}\\) and (zo) is now a function of two sets of numbers, the \\(\\alpha\\)'s and the \\(\\kappa\\)'s, and may be written \\(x_{\\bullet\\circ}\\,(\\texttt{zo})_{\\star}\\).\n\nIn the quantum solution of the problem, according to Heisenberg, we still assume that each co-ordinate can be represented by harmonic components of the form \\(\\exp.\\,i\\alpha t\\), the amplitude and frequency of each depending on two sets of numbers \\(n_{1}\\,...\\,n_{u}\\) and \\(m_{1}\\,...\\,m_{u}\\), in this case all integers, and being written \\(x\\,(nm)\\), \\(\\omega\\,(nm)\\). The differences \\(n_{r}-m_{r}\\) correspond to the previous \\(\\alpha_{r}\\), but neither the \\(n\\)'s nor any functions of the \\(n\\)'s and \\(m\\)'s play the part of the previous \\(\\alpha\\)'s in pointing out to which solution each particular harmonic component belongs. We cannot, for instance, take together all the components for which the \\(n\\)'s have a given set of values, and say that these by themselves form a single complete solution of the equations of motion. The quantum solutions are all interlocked, and must be considered as a single whole. The effect of this mathematically is that, while on the classical theory each of the A equations is a relation between amplitudes and frequencies having one particular set of \\(\\kappa\\)'s, the amplitudes and frequencies occurring in a quantum A equation do not have one particular set of values for the \\(n\\)'s, or for any functions of the \\(n\\)'s and \\(m\\)'s, but have their \\(n\\)'s and \\(m\\)'s related in a special way, which will appear later.\n\nOn the classical theory we have the obvious relation\n\n\\[(\\alpha\\circ)_{\\star}+(\\texttt{b}\\circ)_{\\star}=(\\alpha+\\texttt{b},\\,\\, \\omega)_{\\star}.\\]\n\nFollowing Heisenberg, we assume that the corresponding relation on the quantum theory is\n\n\\[\\omega\\,(n,\\,n\\rightarrow\\alpha)+\\omega\\,(n\\rightarrow\\alpha,\\,n \\rightarrow\\alpha-\\beta)=\\omega\\,(n,\\,n\\rightarrow\\alpha-\\beta)\\] or \\[\\omega\\,(nm)+\\omega\\,(mk)=\\omega\\,(nk). \\tag{1}\\]\n\nThis means that \\(\\omega\\,(nm)\\) is of the form \\(\\Omega\\,(n)\\rightarrow\\Omega\\,(m)\\), the \\(\\Omega\\)'s being frequency levels. On Bohr's theory these would be \\(2\\pi/\\hbar\\) times the energy levels, but we do not need to assume this.\n\nOn the classical theory we can multiply two harmonic components related to the same set of \\(\\kappa\\)'s, as follows :=-\n\n\\[a_{\\omega}\\exp.\\ i\\left(\\alpha\\omega\\right)_{\\kappa}t\\cdot b_{\\beta\\kappa}\\exp. \\ i\\left(\\beta\\omega\\right)_{\\kappa}t=\\left(ab\\right)_{\\omega+\\beta_{\\kappa}, \\kappa}\\exp.\\ i\\left(\\alpha+\\beta,\\omega\\right)_{\\kappa}t\\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\\left(ab\\right)_{\\omega+\\beta_{\\kappa},\\kappa}=a_{\\omega}b_{\\beta\\kappa}.\\]\n\nIn a corresponding manner on the quantum theory we can multiply an \\(\\left(nm\\right)\\) and an \\(\\left(mk\\right)\\) component\n\n\\[a\\left(nm\\right)\\exp.\\ i\\alpha\\left(nm\\right)t\\cdot b\\left(mk\\right)\\exp.\\ i \\omega\\left(mk\\right)t=ab\\ \\left(nk\\right)\\exp.\\ i\\omega\\left(nk\\right)t\\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[ab\\ (nk)=a\\left(nm\\right)b\\left(mk\\right).\\]\n\nWe are thus led to consider the product of the amplitudes of an \\(\\left(nm\\right)\\) and an \\(\\left(mk\\right)\\) component as an \\(\\left(nk\\right)\\) amplitude. This, together with the rule that only amplitudes related to the same pair of sets of numbers can occur added together in an A equation, replaces the classical rule that all amplitudes occurring in an A equation have the same set of \\(\\kappa\\)'s.\n\nWe are now in a position to perform the ordinary algebraic operations on quantum variables. The sum of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is determined by the equations\n\n\\[\\left\\{x+y\\right\\}\\left(nm\\right)=x\\left(nm\\right)\\mp y\\left(nm\\right)\\]\n\nand the product by\n\n\\[xy\\left(nm\\right)=\\Sigma_{k}\\ x(nk)\\ y\\ (km) \\tag{2}\\]\n\nsimilar to the classical product\n\n\\[\\left(xy\\right)_{\\omega\\kappa}=\\Sigma_{k}x_{n}y_{\\omega-\\varepsilon_{\\kappa },\\kappa}.\\]\n\nAn important difference now occurs between the two algebras. In general\n\n\\[xy\\left(nm\\right)\\neq yx\\left(nm\\right)\\]\n\nand quantum multiplication is not commutative, although, as is easily verified, it is associative and distributive. The quantity with components \\(xy\\left(nm\\right)\\) defined by (2) we shall call the Heisenberg product of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and shall write simply as \\(xy\\). Whenever two quantum quantities occur multiplied together, the Heisenberg product will be understood. Ordinary multiplication is, of course, implied in the products of amplitudes and frequencies and other quantities that are related to sets of \\(n\\)'s which are explicitly stated.\n\nThe reciprocal of a quantum quantity \\(x\\) may be defined by either of the relations\n\n\\[1/x\\cdot x=1\\quad\\text{or}\\quad x\\cdot 1/x=1. \\tag{3}\\]\n\nThese two equations are equivalent, since if we multiply both sides of the former by \\(x\\) in front and divide by \\(x\\) behind we get the latter. In a similar way the square root of \\(x\\) may be defined by\n\n\\[\\sqrt{x}\\cdot\\sqrt{x}=x. \\tag{4}\\]\n\nIt is not obvious that there always should be solutions to (3) and (4). In particular, one may have to introduce sub-harmonics, _i.e._, new intermediate frequency levels, in order to express \\(\\sqrt{x}\\). One may evade these difficulties by rationalising and multiplying up each equation before interpreting it on the quantum theory and obtaining the \\(\\Lambda\\) equations from it.\n\nWe are now able to take over each of the equations of motion of the system into the quantum theory. provided we can decide the correct order of the quantities in each of the products. Any equation deducible from the equations of motion by algebraic processes not involving the interchange of the factors of a product, and by differentiation and integration with respect to \\(t\\), may also be taken over into the quantum theory. In particular, the energy equation may be thus taken over.\n\nThe equations of motion do not suffice to solve the quantum problem. On the classical theory the equations of motion do not determine the \\(x_{\\mbox{\\tiny{ac}}}\\), \\((\\mathbf{x}\\circ\\mathbf{\\alpha})_{\\mbox{\\tiny{s}}}\\) as functions of the \\(\\kappa\\)'s until we assume something about the \\(\\kappa\\)'s which serves to define them. We could, if we liked, complete the solution by choosing the \\(\\kappa\\)'s such that \\(\\partial\\mbox{E}/\\partial\\kappa_{\\mbox{\\tiny{r}}}=\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{r}}}/2\\pi\\), where \\(\\mbox{E}\\) is the energy of the system, which would make the \\(\\kappa_{\\mbox{\\tiny{r}}}\\) equal the action variables \\(\\mbox{J}_{\\mbox{\\tiny{r}}}\\). There must be corresponding equations on the quantum theory, and these constitute the quantum conditions.\n\n## 3 Quantum Differentiation\n\nUp to the present the only differentiation that we have considered on the quantum theory is that with respect to the time \\(t\\). We shall now determine the form of the most general quantum operation \\(d/dv\\) that satisfies the laws\n\n\\[\\frac{d}{dv}\\;(x\\vdash y)=\\frac{d}{dv}\\;x\\vdash\\frac{d}{dv}\\;y,\\] (I)\n\nand\n\n\\[\\frac{d}{dv}\\;(xy)=\\frac{d}{dv}\\;x\\cdot y\\vdash x\\cdot\\frac{d}{dv}\\;y.\\] (II)\n\n(Note that the order of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is preserved in the last equation.)\n\nThe first of these laws requires that the amplitudes of the components of \\(dx/dv\\) shall be linear functions of those of \\(x\\), _i.e._,\n\n\\[dx/dv\\;(nm)=\\Sigma_{\\mbox{\\tiny{n}}\\,\\mbox{\\tiny{m}}\\,\\mbox{\\tiny{m}}}\\;a\\; (nm\\;;\\;n^{\\prime}m^{\\prime})\\;x\\;(n^{\\prime}m^{\\prime}). \\tag{5}\\]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\nNow\n\n\\[2\\pi i\\beta_{\\sigma\\!\\!/\\sigma}\\exp.i\\left(\\beta\\omega\\right)t=\\frac{\\partial}{ \\partial w_{\\tau}}\\left(y_{\\mu}\\exp.i\\left(\\beta\\omega\\right)t\\right.\\]\n\nwhere the \\(w_{\\tau}\\) are the angle variables, equal to \\(\\omega_{\\tau}\\!\\!/2\\pi\\). Hence the \\(\\left(nm\\right)\\) component of \\(\\left(xy\\!\\!\\!-yx\\right)\\) corresponds on the classical theory to\n\n\\[\\frac{i\\hbar}{2\\pi}\\Sigma_{a+b\\,=\\,-n-m}\\Sigma_{\\tau}\\left\\{ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\kappa_{\\tau}}\\left(x_{a}\\,\\exp.i\\left(\\alpha\\omega \\right)t\\right)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w_{\\tau}}\\left(y_{\\beta}\\exp.i\\left( \\beta\\omega\\right)t\\right)\\right.\\] \\[\\left.-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\kappa_{\\tau}}\\left\\{y_{\\beta}\\exp.i\\left(\\beta\\omega\\right)t\\right\\}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w_{\\tau}}\\left(x_ {a}\\exp.i\\left(\\alpha\\omega\\right)t\\right)\\right\\}\\]\n\nor \\(\\left(xy\\!\\!\\!-yx\\right)\\) itself corresponds to\n\n\\[-\\frac{i\\hbar}{2\\pi}\\Sigma_{\\tau}\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\kappa_{\\tau }}\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial w_{\\tau}}-\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial\\kappa_{ \\tau}}\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial w_{\\tau}}\\right\\}.\\]\n\nIf we make the \\(\\kappa_{\\tau}\\) equal the action variables \\(\\mathbb{J}_{\\tau}\\) this becomes \\(i\\hbar/2\\pi\\) times the Poisson (or Jacobi) bracket expression\n\n\\[\\left[\\!\\!\\left[x,y\\right]\\!\\!\\!\\right]=\\Sigma_{\\tau}\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial x} {\\partial w_{\\tau}}\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial\\mathbb{J}_{\\tau}}-\\frac{ \\partial y}{\\partial w_{\\tau}}\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial\\mathbb{J}_{\\tau}} \\right\\}=\\Sigma_{\\tau}\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial\\tau}\\frac{\\partial y} {\\partial p_{\\tau}}-\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial q_{\\tau}}\\frac{\\partial x}{ \\partial p_{\\tau}}\\right\\}\\]\n\nwhere the \\(p\\)'s and \\(q\\)'s are any set of canonical variables of the system.\n\nThe elementary Poisson bracket expressions for various combinations of the \\(p\\)'s and \\(q\\)'s are\n\n\\[\\left[\\!\\!\\left[q_{r},q_{s}\\right]\\!\\!\\right]=0,\\qquad\\left[\\!\\!\\left[p_{r},p_ {s}\\right]\\!\\!\\right]=0,\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad \\qquad\\qquadWe have seen that this is equivalent, in the limiting case of the classical theory, to taking the arbitrary quantities \\(\\kappa_{r}\\) that label a solution equal to the \\(J_{r}\\), and it seems reasonable to take (11) as constituting the general quantum conditions.\n\nIt is not obvious that all the information supplied by equation (11) is consistent. Owing to the fact that the quantities on either side of (11) satisfy the same laws \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{II}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{Ia}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{II}\\), the only independent conditions given by (11) are those for which \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are \\(p\\)'s or \\(q\\)'s, namely\n\n\\[q_{r}q_{*}-q_{r}q_{r} \\equiv 0\\] \\[p_{r}p_{*} \\equiv p_{i}p_{r} \\equiv 0\\] \\[q_{r}p_{*} \\equiv p_{d}q_{r} \\equiv 8_{n}\\,i\\hbar/2\\pi \\tag{12}\\]\n\nIf the only grounds for believing that the equations (12) were consistent with each other and with the equations of motion were that they are known to be consistent in the limit when \\(\\hbar\\to 0\\), the case would not be very strong, since one might be able to deduce from them the inconsistency that \\(\\hbar=0\\), which would not be an inconsistency in the limit. There is much stronger evidence than this, however, owing to the fact that the classical operations obey the same laws as the quantum ones, so that if, by applying the quantum operations, one can get an inconsistency, by applying the classical operations in the same way one must also get an inconsistency. If a series of classical operations leads to the equation \\(0=0\\), the corresponding series of quantum operations must also lead to the equation \\(0=0\\), and not to \\(\\hbar=0\\), since there is no way of obtaining a quantity that does not vanish by a quantum operation with quantum variables such that the corresponding classical operation with the corresponding classical variables gives a quantity that does vanish. The possibility mentioned above of deducing by quantum operations the inconsistency \\(\\hbar=0\\) thus cannot occur. _The correspondence between the quantum and classical theories lies not so much in the limiting agreement when \\(\\hbar\\to 0\\) as in the fact that the mathematical operations on the two theories obey in many cases the same laws._\n\nFor a system of one degree of freedom, if we take \\(p=m\\,\\dot{q}\\), the only quantum condition is\n\n\\[2\\pi m\\,(q\\,\\dot{q}\\rightharpoonup\\dot{q}\\,q)=i\\hbar.\\]\n\nEquating the constant part of the left-hand side to \\(i\\hbar\\), we get\n\n\\[\\ast\\,\\,\\,4\\pi m\\,\\Sigma_{k}\\,q\\,(nk)\\,q\\,(kn)\\,\\omega\\,(kn)=h.\\]This is equivalent to Heisenberg's quantum condition.* By equating the remaining components of the left-hand side to zero we get further relations not given by Heisenberg's theory.\n\nFootnote *: Heisenberg, _loc. cit._ equation (16).\n\nThe quantum conditions (12) get over, in many cases, the difficulties concerning the order in which quantities occurring in products in the equations of motion are to be taken. The order does not matter except when a \\(p_{r}\\) and \\(q\\), are multiplied together, and this never occurs in a system describable by a potential energy function that depends only on the \\(q\\)'s, and a kinetic energy function that depends only on the \\(p\\)'s.\n\nIt may be pointed out that the classical theory quantity occurring in Kramers' and Heisenberg's theory of scattering by atoms+ has components which are of the form (8) (with \\(\\kappa_{r}=J_{r}\\)), and which are interpreted on the quantum theory in a manner in agreement with the present theory. No classical expression involving differential coefficients can be interpreted on the quantum theory unless it can be put into this form.\n\nFootnote †: \\({}^{\\dagger}\\): Heisenberg, _loc. cit._ equation (16).\n\nSS 5. _Properties of the Quantum Poisson Bracket Expressions_.\n\nIn this section we shall deduce certain results that are independent of the assumption of the quantum conditions (11) or (12).\n\nThe Poisson bracket expressions satisfy on the classical theory the identity\n\n\\[[x,\\,y,\\,z]\\equiv[[x,\\,y],\\,z]+[[y,\\,z],\\,x]+[[z,\\,x],\\,y]=0. \\tag{13}\\]\n\nOn the quantum theory this result is obviously true when \\(x\\), \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) are \\(p\\)'s or \\(q\\)'s. Also, from IA and IIA\n\n\\[[x_{1}+x_{2},\\,y,\\,z]=[x_{1},\\,y,\\,z]+[x_{2},\\,y,\\,z]\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[[x_{1},\\,x_{2},\\,y,\\,z]=x_{1}[x_{2},\\,y,\\,z]+[x_{1},\\,y,\\,z]\\,x_{2}.\\]\n\nHence the result must still be true on the quantum theory when \\(x\\), \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) are expressible in any way as sums and products of \\(p\\)'s and \\(q\\)'s, so that it must be generally true. Note that the identity corresponding to (13) when the Poisson bracket expressions are replaced by the differences of the Heisenberg products \\((xy-yx)\\) is obviously true, so that there is no inconsistency with equation (11).\n\nIf H is the Hamiltonian function of the system, the equations of motion may be written classically\n\n\\[\\dot{p}_{r}=[p_{r},\\,\\mbox{H}]\\qquad\\qquad\\dot{q}_{r}=[q_{r},\\,\\mbox{H}].\\]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:10]\n\nmay, for instance, be \\(\\eta_{\\mu}\\vec{\\zeta}_{\\tau}==-i/2\\pi\\cdot{\\bf J}_{\\tau}\\) or \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\vec{\\zeta}_{\\tau}\\eta_{\\tau}+\\eta_{\\tau}\\vec{\\zeta}_{\\tau} \\right)==-i/2\\pi\\cdot{\\bf J}_{\\tau}\\). \\(\\Delta\\) detailed investigation of any particular dynamical system is necessary in order to decide what it is. In the event of the last relation being true, we can introduce the set of canonical variables \\(\\xi_{\\tau}\\), \\(\\eta_{\\tau}\\) defined by\n\n\\[\\xi_{\\tau}^{\\prime}=(\\vec{\\zeta}_{\\tau}+i\\eta_{\\tau})/\\surd 2,\\qquad\\eta_{\\tau}^{ \\prime}=(i\\vec{\\zeta}_{\\tau}+i\\eta_{\\tau})/\\surd 2,\\]\n\nand shall then have\n\n\\[{\\bf J}_{\\tau}=\\pi\\,(\\vec{\\xi}_{\\tau}{}^{\\prime 2}+\\eta_{\\tau}{}^{\\prime 2}).\\]\n\nThis is the case that actually occurs for the harmonic oscillator. In general \\({\\bf J}_{\\tau}\\) is not necessarily even a rational function of the \\(\\xi_{\\tau}\\) and \\(\\eta_{\\tau}\\), an example of this being the rigid rotator considered by Heisenberg.\n\n## 6 The Stationary States.\n\nA quantity C, that does not vary with the time, has all its \\((nm)\\) components zero, except those for which \\(n=m\\). It thus becomes convenient to suppose each set of \\(n\\)'s to be associated with a definite state of the atom, as on Bohr's theory, so that each C \\((nn)\\) belongs to a certain state in precisely the same way in which _every_ quantity occurring in the classical theory belongs to a certain configuration. The components of a varying quantum quantity are so interlocked, however, that it is impossible to associate the sum of certain of them with a given state.\n\nA relation between quantum quantities reduces, when all the quantities are constants, to a relation between C\\((nn)\\)'s belonging to a definite stationary state \\(n\\). This relation will be the same as the classical theory relation, on the assumption that the classical laws hold for the description of the stationary states ; in particular, the energy will be the same function of the J's as on the classical theory. We have here a justification for Bohr's assumption of the mechanical nature of the stationary states. It should be noted though, that the variable quantities associated with a stationary state on Bohr's theory, the amplitudes and frequencies of orbital motion, have no physical meaning and are of no mathematical importance.\n\nIf we apply the fundamental equation (11) to the quantities \\(x\\) and \\({\\bf H}\\) we get, with the help of (14),\n\n\\[x\\;(nm)\\;{\\bf H}\\;(mm)\\;{\\bf\\rightarrow}\\;{\\bf H}\\;(nn)\\;x\\;(nm)=\\;ih/2\\pi \\cdot{\\bf\\dot{x}}\\;(nm)=\\;-\\;h/2\\pi\\cdot{\\bf\\dot{}}\\;(nm)=\\;-\\;h/2\\pi\\cdot{\\bf \\dot{}}\\;(nm)\\;x\\;(nm),\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[{\\bf\\dot{}}\\;(nn)\\;{\\bf\\rightarrow}\\;{\\bf H}\\;(mm)=h/2\\pi\\cdot{\\bf\\dot{}}\\;( nm).\\]\n\nThis is just Bohr's relation connecting the frequencies with the energy differences.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:12]"},"metadata":{},"execution_count":10}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Example - Indic lang.
